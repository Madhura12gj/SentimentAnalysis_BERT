# SentimentAnalysis_BERT

## Problem statement
The goal is to train a deep neural network to predict the sentiment of (hate) speech text.

## Solution
The problem is solved using recent text classification model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers)
This repository contains two notebooks. The solution to this problem statement is implemented in Pytorch and in Tensorflow using BERT in both cases.
